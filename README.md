## Hi :)

This is my [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Demo project.

It can be seen live here: https://demo-app-svoby.vercel.app

## What I did

* I've gradually fixed and refactored original source code (see commits history)
* fixed cycled component refresh (setState inside useEffect)
* binded this.handleOnClick in constructor
* added key to array map
* made shouldComponentUpdate a bit cleaner
* mede all as a functional components
* rewrote the whole application.

## You can try it out locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Thanks
Lubo≈°
